 Absolutely! Here's your **Bank Customer Churn Prediction summary** in the same professional and structured format: --- # 🏦 Bank – Customer Churn Prediction with Logistic Regression ### 🔍 Project Overview This project is a **Python-based churn prediction model** aimed at identifying customers who are likely to leave the bank. Using a dataset of 10,000 customers, it combines **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with a **logistic regression model** to uncover key drivers of churn and generate actionable insights. The primary goal is to support customer retention by identifying high-risk segments based on behavior and demographics. --- ### 📌 Key Insights * **Gender-Based Churn**   * **Female customers** have a churn rate of **25.07%**, higher than **16.47%** for males.   * Targeting female retention could yield major improvements. * **Country-Level Churn**   * **Germany** shows the highest churn at **32.44%**.   * France and Spain show relatively low churn rates (\~16%). * **Age-Wise Churn**   * **50–60 age group** is most vulnerable with **56.21%** churn.   * Followed by **40–50 group** at **33.96%**.   * Older customers are at significantly higher risk. * **Tenure-Based Insights**   * Even loyal customers (10 years) show **20%** churn.   * Early exits (<1 year) are also high at **23%**. * **Activity Status**   * **Non-active members**: **27%** churn   * **Active members**: only **14%** * **Number of Products**   * Customers with **3 products** have a massive **83% churn**.   * More products don’t always mean more satisfaction. * **Balance and Credit Score**   * Around **3,500 customers** have a **zero balance**—a potential sign of disengagement.   * Credit score is **normally distributed**, with a mean of **\~650**. --- ### 📈 Model Performance * Built using **Logistic Regression** * Achieved an **accuracy of 81%** * Suitable for large-scale churn risk flagging --- ### 🧠 Tools Used * Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
